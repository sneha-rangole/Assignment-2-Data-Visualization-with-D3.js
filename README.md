# Data Visualization with D3.js - COVID-19 Cases

This project involves creating interactive visualizations of COVID-19 data using D3.js. The visualizations provide insights into the distribution of COVID-19 cases across different countries and regions, showcasing key metrics such as active cases, deaths, confirmed cases, and recovered cases.

## Dataset Selection and Preprocessing

### Dataset

- **COVID-19 Cases Dataset:** Includes information on active cases, deaths, confirmed cases, and recovered cases based on country.

### Preprocessing

- **Tool Used:** OpenRefine
- **Steps Involved:**
  - Filtering
  - Normalization

  These steps ensured the data was clean and suitable for visualization purposes.

## Visualization Design

### 1. Map Visualization

- **Description:** Displays COVID-19 data on a world map.
- **Features:**
  - Each country is represented by a point whose size corresponds to the magnitude of COVID-19 cases.
  - Interactive tooltips provide additional information when hovering over a country.
  - Filter option allows users to switch between different metrics (confirmed cases, active cases, deaths, recovered cases).

### 2. Bar Chart

- **Description:** Provides a complementary perspective by displaying COVID-19 cases sorted by WHO region.
- **Features:**
  - Allows users to compare the distribution of cases across different regions.

## Advanced Features Implementation

### Interactive Filtering

- **Description:** Enhances the map visualization by allowing users to filter based on different metrics.
- **Benefit:** Improves usability and enables users to focus on specific aspects of the data.

## Documentation and Analysis

### Visualization Design Choices

- **Rationale:** Selected the COVID-19 dataset due to its global relevance and richness in detail.
- **Preprocessing:** Cleaned the data to ensure accuracy and consistency.

### Insights Provided

- **Distribution Analysis:** Visualizations reveal the distribution of COVID-19 cases across different countries and regions.
- **Comparative Analysis:** Bar chart provides a comparative view of cases by WHO region.
